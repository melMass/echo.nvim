# Some builtin sounds

These are converted from this [Sound Kit](https://design.facebook.com/toolsandresources/sound-kit-for-prototypes), see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)


I mainly used them for prototyping this project and for now they are bundled in the binary and callable using `require("echo").play_bultin("Button 3")`
